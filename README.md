Intake, on this image I submit a ticket on behalf of a user to create the first step in our ticketing lifecycle. 

  - Fill in the info requested for the new ticket
  - Select the help topic for the ticket
  - Issue a summary for the ticket
</p>

<p>
In this step, I log in as an IT agent (lead/manager) to review the submitted tickets. I review the following items to ensure I address the problem accordingly. 

  - Review the impact of the issue to set the priority accordingly
  - Assignment of the ticket to the agents (ensure the correct team or individual is assigned to the ticket)
  - Set the correct department to address the ticket issue
  - Update SLA to the level of severity

<p>
In this step, I resolve the ticket and communicate with our business user within the ticket

   - Update notes on tickets to communicate with the business users of the next steps and acknowledgment of the ticket is received
  - Resolve/Close the ticket once a resolution has been communicated to the business user
